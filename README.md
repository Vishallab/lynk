## Known Issues

- **App Reload on Like**: When a user clicks the like button, the entire app reloads due to the use of Firestore instead of Firebase Realtime Database. This can cause a less than optimal user experience.
- **Messaging Feature**: The messaging feature is not yet implemented. Future updates will include the ability for users to send private messages to each other.
- **Activity vs. Fragment**: The app currently uses Activities for navigation, but it can be improved by using Fragments for better performance and navigation management.

## Future Improvements

- **Messaging**: Implement a private messaging feature allowing users to send and receive messages.
- **Fragment Integration**: Refactor the app to use Fragments instead of Activities to improve performance and navigation.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Optimize the real-time updates to avoid reloading the entire app on specific interactions.
- **UI/UX Enhancements**: Improve the overall user interface and user experience.
